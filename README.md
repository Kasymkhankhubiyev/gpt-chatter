# GPT Chatter

GPT Chatter is a simple local chatbot application built with Streamlit that uses GPT to generate responses. The application allows you to interact with a conversational AI model in your browser.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.7 or later installed on your system.
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) installed. You can install it via pip:

  ```bash
  pip install streamlit
  ```    

## Installation
**Clone the repository**:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gpt_chatter.git

**Navigate to the project directory:**

cd gpt_chatter

**Install the required Python packages:**

poetry install

## Configuration
To configure your GPT Chatter, create .streamlit/secrets.toml in your project directory with your actual API details:

Replace your_api_key with your API key.
Replace your-base-url with the base URL for your GPT model, if required.
Your .streamlit/secrets.toml should look something like this:

[api]
key = "your_actual_api_key"
base_url = "your_actual_base_url"

## Running the Application
To run the GPT Chatter app, use the following command:

streamlit run gpt_chatter/app.py

This will start a local server, and you can access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:8501.

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can enter text into the chat interface and receive responses generated by the GPT model. The application showcases the capabilities of GPT in a simple, interactive chat format.
